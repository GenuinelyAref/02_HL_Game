# Higher/Lower Game

# Version 1.4 log

# To do:
# 1a) (Theoretical) Make different boundary requirements for each difficulty
# 1b) (Practical) Cut, then paste boundary inputs 3 times for each difficulty, with different max\min  values for each
# 2) Add option to choose your own number of guesses
# 3) Change location of "Rounds" explanation to the beginning with the into + instructions
# 4a) Changing most 'else' statements into 'elif', and changing the 'else' statements into error messages of the
#     code not working properly (ie: code should never reach 'else' part of the code, only 'if' or 'elif')
# 4b) Create READ_ME file with all error messages and their convenience defined, and how to troubleshoot them.
# 5) Improve bits and pieces of the visual appeal of the project

# >>> Ideas for future versions:
# Change difficulties to: Easy, Challenging, Hard and Extreme
# Give more accurate feedback (low rather than too low or high rather than too high)
# Add suggestions-taking code + link to local storage (database perhaps)
# Use statement generator more often for visual appeal
# Add animation at the end of the game
# Create Developer mode: asks for password first > then allows user to use program without any limitations
# Create Casual/fun mode: asks for password first > normal program but with funny elements (ie: number of guesses =
#       letters in user's name & max rounds = their age etc...)
# PLay some music?
